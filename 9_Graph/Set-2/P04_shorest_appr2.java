/*Implement Code in java in which we will implement An efficient approach is to use the property 
of 2*x and 2*x+1 given. Keep dividing the larger of the two nodes by 2. 
If the larger becomes the smaller one, then divide the other one. 
At a stage, both the values will be the same, keep a count on the number of divisions done which will be the answer.  

Time Complexity: O(log(max(x, y)))
Space Comeplxity : O(1) */
