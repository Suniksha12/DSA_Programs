/* Implement a program to validate an IPv4 Address.
 * 
 * According to Wikipedia, IPv4 addresses are canonically represented in 
 * dot-decimal notation, which consists of four decimal numbers, each ranging from 0 to 255,
 *  separated by dots, e.g., 172.16.254.1
 * 
 * Approach 1 - Simple Approach
 * 
 * Time Complexity : O(n)
 * Space Complexity : O(1)
