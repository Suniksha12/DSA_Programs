/*Implement a Code in java in which we have been Given a Linked List of M nodes and a number N,
 find the value at the Nth node from the end of the Linked List. 
 If there is no Nth node from the end, print -1.

Examples:

Input: 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4, N = 3
Output: 2
Explanation: Node 2 is the third node from the end of the linked list.

Input: 35 -> 15 -> 4 -> 20, N = 4
Output: 35
Explanation: Node 35 is the fourth node from the end of the linked list.
